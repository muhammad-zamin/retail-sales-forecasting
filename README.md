# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Forecasting with Time Series (Internship Project)

This project was completed as part of a 25-day Data Science Internship. The goal was to build a time series forecasting model to predict monthly retail sales for the next 6 months, using mock historical data.

---

## üìå Project Objective

Forecast monthly sales for a retail store to support:
- Inventory management
- Financial planning
- Marketing strategy

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Type:** Mock retail sales data
- **Duration:** 4 years (Jan 2020 ‚Äì Dec 2023)
- **Columns:** Date, SalesAmount, Promotion, HolidayMonth

---

## üß± Steps Completed

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time series visualization
- Decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual)
- ADF test for stationarity
- ACF/PACF plots

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Lag features (lag_1, lag_12)
- Rolling mean (3-month)
- Date parts (month, quarter)
- External features: Promotion, HolidayMonth

### 3. Model Building
- Used SARIMAX model: (1,1,1)(0,1,1,12)
- Trained on 42 months, validated on last 6
- Performance:
  - MAE: 814.37
  - RMSE: 1012.38

### 4. Forecasting
- Forecasted sales for Jan‚ÄìJun 2024
- Included exogenous variables
- Confidence intervals generated
